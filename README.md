This Project aims to colorizes black-and-white images using a deep learning model pre-trained on color images. The model is based on a neural network architecture for image colorization, leveraging the Caffe deep learning framework and pre-trained weights. The script transforms the input grayscale image into a colorized version using the LAB color space.

Inspiration 
1. https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/dnn/colorization.py
2. http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/
3. https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/

Download these and store them in model folder 
1. colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt: https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/tree/caffe/colorization/models
2. pts_in_hull.npy: https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/caffe/colorization/resources/pts_in_hull.npy
3. colorization_release_v2.caffemodel: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dx0qvhhp5hbcx7z/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel?dl=1

file no 3 exceeds the max size so havent uplaoded it here , download it and store it in model folder
